Welcome to ClipNoti - the clipboard notifier!

This is a small AutoHotkey script that notifies you when you have successfully copied something by animating the mouse pointer.

## Why?
Has this ever happened to you?

![Demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/SfWtDSmPLy62ZmXOpw/source.gif?cid=790b7611773a43bdddf1d9daf28b80ebfbafd0379157a82f&rid=source.gif&ct=g)

Far too many times I have tried to copy something but accidentally misclicked the Fn button without realizing it. This script lets you know when you have actually pressed Ctrl + C or not.

## Installation
ClipNoti is written in AutoHotkey, which has to be installed to run this script. You can install AutoHotkey by going to the official [AutoHotkey website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Unfortunately, AutoHotkey is only available for Windows, for the time being, so the Windows operating system is a prerequisite.

To automatically start the script every time you start the computer, use the following instructions or see the [official documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup).
> There are several ways to make a script (or any program) launch automatically every time you start your PC. The easiest is to place a shortcut to the script in the Startup folder:
>1. Find the script file, select it, and press Ctrl+C.
>2. Press Win+R to open the Run dialog, then enter `shell:startup` and click OK or Enter. This will open the Startup folder for the current user. To instead open the folder for all users, enter `shell:common startup` (however, in that case, you must be an administrator to proceed).
>3. Right-click inside the window, and click "Paste Shortcut". The shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.

## Usage
Using the script is pretty simple;
 1. Double click on ClipNoti.ahk
 2. Try to Copy something
 3. Success
